# Decision Fatigue Simulator

Decision Fatigue Simulator is a lightweight frontend web application that helps users make simple everyday decisions when mental clarity is low. The application reduces decision overload by guiding users through a small set of focused questions and generating a clear outcome using rule-based logic.

The project is built using plain HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, with no external libraries or frameworks. The primary goal is to demonstrate strong frontend fundamentals such as DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional rendering, and clean UI flow design.

## Why This Project

Decision-making fatigue is a common real-world problem, yet most tools add more complexity instead of reducing it. This project intentionally limits choices and interactions to reflect how effective decisions are made under low mental energy. The focus is on simplicity, clarity, and user flow rather than feature overload.
